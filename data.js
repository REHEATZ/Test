Colonel Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant inherited the castle and expanded it significantly following his rise in status to the 1st Lord Penrhyn. This Coal Yard was constructed as a part of this expansion in 1868 and it mostly held wood and coal for use in the servant’s quarters.&nbsp;The Castle was given to the National Trust to be managed in 1951 after the death of the 4th Lord Penrhyn, Hugh Napier, in 1949.&nbsp;<br>"
